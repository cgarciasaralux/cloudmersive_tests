Rule 11 states that the admissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Rule 410, and the obvious meaning of this provision is that, during proceedings governed by the FRE, Rule 410 governs the admissibility of utterances that a defendant might be expected to make during the plea process, the subject matter of Rule 11. The FRE, however, do not apply to sentencing, by operation of Rule 1101(d). Accordingly, Rule 11 and Rule 410 are inapplicable and pose no impediment to the admission of such statements during a forfeiture hearing, and where the statements were admitted during the forfeiture hearing, and not during the government’s case in chief, the proffer letter posed no barrier to their admission. <a class="casename" data-docid="131999-CH" data-case-volume="770" data-case-reporter="F.3d" data-case-page="628" data-case-exclusion=", 770 F.3d 628"><casename>United States v.

Thus, the defendant’s assumption that the court excluded the chat logs from the hearing, based on the result of that hearing—an order requiring him to pay for most of the victim’s psychotherapy expenses—without any indication in the record that the chat logs were in fact excluded, was deemed improper because it ignored the language of Rule 1101(d). <a class="casename" data-docid="131999-CH" data-case-volume="685" data-case-reporter="F.3d" data-case-page="600" data-case-exclusion=", 685 F.3d 600"><casename>United States v.

First, it gives the trial judge the information needed to make an informed ruling. Judges are not mind readers, and even the most prepared judge cannot possibly know as much about a party’s case (and strategy) as the lawyer who is trying it. Thus, when the relevance of a particular line of questioning is not self-evident, an explanation of what the anticipated answers will be and how those answers advance the party’s theory of the case is critical. Second, without that explanation there is no way for a reviewing court to determine whether excluding the evidence was prejudicial. <a class="casename" data-docid="131999-CH" data-case-volume="758" data-case-reporter="F.3d" data-case-page="875" data-case-exclusion=", 758 F.3d 875"><casename>Wilson v.

Thus, a party cannot offer testimony for one reason and later complain that it should have been admitted for another reason, because to do so defeats the purpose of requiring an offer of proof.

Alternatively, to make a proffer, counsel may—in the court’s discretion—put the witness on the stand, outside the presence of the jury, and elicit responses in a question-and-answer format before the judge.

First, trial courts can screen out experts who would act as mere conduits for hearsay by strictly enforcing the requirement that experts display some genuine scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge that will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, as required under Rule 702(a). Second, experts are generally precluded from disclosing inadmissible evidence to a jury by operation of Rule 703. Third, if such evidence is disclosed, pursuant to Rules 105 and 703, the trial judges may and, under most circumstances, must, instruct the jury that out-of-court statements cannot be accepted for their truth and that an expert’s opinion is only as good as the independent evidence that establishes its underlying premises.

Thus, where a defendant contended that the remainder of recorded conversations should be played for the jury in a prosecution under RICO, but failed to show that all of the remaining portions of the recorded conversations were relevant and that they either qualified or explained the subject matter of the portions that the government intended to offer into evidence, the defendant failed to establish that the remaining portions were admissible via Rule 106.

The lack of a rule governing judicial notice of legislative facts renders inappropriate any limitation in the form of indisputability, any formal requirements of notice other than those already inherent in affording opportunity to hear and be heard and exchanging briefs, and any requirement of formal findings at any level. Thus, while courts may take judicial notice of either legislative or adjudicative facts, only notice of the latter is subject to the strictures of Rule 201. United States v. Knauer, 707 F.

P. 9006(e) provides that service of notice by mail is complete upon mailing. This rule has been read in combination with the common-law doctrine recognizing that <b>a rebuttable presumption arises that a properly mailed item is received by the addressee</b>. Thus, the fact that a creditor’s name and address were properly listed on the matrix of creditors that the clerk of the bankruptcy court uses to mail notices of the debtors’ filing is sufficient to raise the presumption that the creditor received such notice. Such a presumption is strong and is not easily rebutted, and mere denial of receipt by the addressees of notices sent by the bankruptcy court, standing alone, is insufficient to rebut the presumption of receipt. However, evidence that indicates the procedure that the objecting party engages when receiving mail, particularly a bankruptcy notice, coupled with the testimony of the officers that <div class="notext"><p class="bpage" name="" id="">====== <b>119</b> ======</p></div><p></p>the complaint was not received, would be sufficient to overcome the presumption of receipt created by operation of Rule 301. <i>In re</i> Arnold, 2010 Bankr.

This form of improper reasoning is distinct from improper propensity reasoning of the kind most frequently addressed in Rule 404(a)(1).

The danger of admitting evidence from which the jury could draw a propensity inference in violation of Rule 404(b) is that, regardless of the reason the evidence was actually admitted, the jury might still draw that improper inference. Almost any bad-acts evidence simultaneously condemns by besmirching character and by showing one or more of the purposes listed in Rule 404(b). That inherent risk of prejudice against the defendant is unavoidable, and excluding other-acts evidence on that basis would make it nearly impossible to ever admit such evidence.

Rule 403 does much of the heavy lifting in this admissibility analysis by excluding other-acts evidence that may be slightly probative through a non-propensity theory, but that has a high likelihood of creating unfair prejudice by leading a jury to draw conclusions based on propensity.

In making this determination, the district court is not merely to consider the sufficiency of the evidentiary alternatives, but rather whether the evidence on one side is so full that no jury that rejected it would be likely to change its mind because of the introduction of the proffered evidence. If in order to find against the proponent the jury would have to find that ten eyewitnesses lied, there has to be some special justification for supposing a favorable judgment on the credibility of an eleventh witness to the same facts. This is a rather severe test for the exclusion of cumulative evidence, but it is necessary if the judge is to be prevented from using Rule 403 as a device for usurping the function of the jury. <a class="casename" data-docid="131999-CH" data-case-volume="597" data-case-reporter="F.3d" data-case-page="399" data-case-exclusion=", 597 F.3d 399"><casename>United States v.

To mitigate that risk, <b>after a Rule 414 analysis</b>, the district court must carefully consider whether prior-bad-acts evidence should be excluded pursuant to Rule 403.

Even though Congress has made the propensity inference permissible, it has not said that evidence falling within Rule 413 is per se non-prejudicial. To the contrary, a jury might use such evidence, for example, to convict a defendant because it is appalled by a prior crime the defendant committed rather than persuaded that he committed the crime charged. Or a jury, uncertain of guilt, may convict a defendant because they think the defendant is a bad person generally deserving of punishment. Rule 403 remains an important safeguard against the admission of prejudicial evidence, and courts enjoy wide discretion in applying the rule.

Other-acts evidence need not be excluded whenever a propensity inference can be drawn. But its relevance to “another purpose” must be established through a chain of reasoning that does not rely on the forbidden inference that the person has a certain character and acted in accordance with that character on the occasion charged in the case. If the proponent can make this initial showing, the district court must in every case assess whether the probative value of the other-acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice and may exclude the evidence under Rule 403 if the risk is too great.

The rule addresses two main policy concerns: (1) that the jury may convict a “bad man” who deserves to be punished not because he is guilty of the crime charged but because of his prior or subsequent misdeeds; and (2) that the jury will infer that because the accused committed other crimes he probably committed the crime charged. Both these rationales appear at first glance to be one-sided—that is, they should preclude the introduction of the defendant’s prior bad acts, but they should not preclude the defendant’s introduction of prior bad acts committed by third parties, namely, the alleged victim. Accordingly, some courts have found that the standards for admission of evidence to show conduct in conformity with prior conduct are relaxed when the defendant attempts to offer the Rule 404(b) evidence, a circumstance popularly known as “reverse 404(b) evidence.” United States v. Ballou, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 160234 (D.N.M. 2014).</p></div><div><p class="pnormal" align="justify"><span class="loc" id="loc03494"></span>The standard of admissibility under Rule 404(b) when a criminal defendant offers similar-acts evidence as a shield need not be as restrictive as when the prosecution uses such evidence as a sword. The prosecution, in the Anglo-American tradition, may not ordinarily offer evidence of a defendant’s prior wrongdoing for the purpose of persuading the jury that the defendant has a propensity for crime and is therefore likely to have committed the offense for which he stands trial. As Dean Wigmore points out, such evidence is objectionable not because it has no appreciable value, but because it has too much. Presumably, the “too much” argument means that a guilty person, and, of far more serious concern, an innocent person, may be convinced primarily because of the jury’s willingness to assume his present guilt from his prior misdeed. Wigmore also identifies objections based on the risk that the jury will convict because the defendant may not have been punished for his prior offenses and the injustice of requiring the defendant to defend against a series of accusations. However, the risks of prejudice are normally absent when the defendant offers similar-acts evidence of a third party to prove some fact pertinent to the defense. In such cases the only issue arising under Rule 404(b) is whether the evidence is relevant to the existence or non-existence of some fact pertinent to the defense. United States v. Ballou, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 160234 (D.N.M. 2014).</p></div><div><p class="pnormal" align="justify"><span class="loc" id="loc03495"></span>Rule 404(b)’s prohibition applies to a defendant who wishes to introduce evidence of wrongdoing by another to establish his innocence, a species of evidence referred to as “reverse 404(b)” evidence.

These criteria, although relevant to measuring the probative value of the defendant’s proffer, should not be erected as absolute barriers to its admission. Rather, a defendant must demonstrate only that the other-crimes proof—known as “reverse 404(b)” evidence—has a tendency to negate his guilt, and that it passes the Rule 403 balancing test.

The offering party must establish the degree of specificity and <b>frequency of uniform response</b> that ensures more than a mere tendency to act in a given manner, but rather, conduct that is ‘semi-automatic’ in nature. In deciding whether certain conduct constitutes habit, courts consider three factors: (1) the degree to which the conduct is reflexive or semi-automatic as opposed to volitional; (2) the specificity or particularity of the con-duct; and (3) the regularity or numerosity of the examples of the conduct. These elements are not meant to be three discrete components, each of which must be fully satisfied for evidence to qualify under Rule 406.

Evidence of a “habit” would, in most circumstances, provide sufficient factual basis for a reasonable inference about what someone would have done in like circumstances. There is no greater leap of faith involved in relying on “habit” evidence to prove an instance of probable conduct under hypothetically similar circumstances, than is involved in using “habit” evidence to prove actual conduct under actually similar circumstances, as expressly sanctioned by Rule 406. In either case, the jury must use “habit” evidence as a predictor of conduct in similar circumstances, and the certainty of the prediction or strength of the inference necessarily depends upon (1) how strong the evidence of “habit” is, and (2) how similar the circumstances in which the “habit” is displayed are to the circumstances (actual or hypothetical) in which the jurors are trying to predict the actor’s conduct.

A common thread in many of these cases is that the subsequent remedial action—the filing of an amended tax return—may not be probative of the defendant’s state of mind at the time the initial tax return was filed because such actions are equally consistent with (1) promptly correcting a genuine mistake and, alternatively, (2) trying to cover up a purposeful lie in the hope of avoiding prosecution. <a class="casename" data-docid="131999-CH" data-case-volume="756" data-case-reporter="F.3d" data-case-page="1044" data-case-exclusion=", 756 F.3d 1044"><casename>United States v.

A district court has the discretion (1) to consider the amounts discussed in settlement negotiations between the parties, or not; and (2) to give those amounts as much or as little weight as it sees fit. <a class="casename" data-docid="131999-CH" data-case-volume="712" data-case-reporter="F.3d" data-case-page="446" data-case-exclusion=", 712 F.3d 446"><casename>A.D. v.

Moreover, the words “such as” in subsection (b) precede only examples of instances where the prohibitions in subsection (a) do not apply, and subsection (b) does not set out an exhaustive list of all possible situations. Thus, under Rule 408, a court must distinguish between the use of settlement communications to resolve a claim and the use of such communications to determine other issues once the court rules on the claim’s merits.

The Rule promotes the resolution of disputes short of litigation, thereby conserving scarce judicial resources, by recognizing that settlements are more likely to result when parties are free to speak openly during settlement negotiations, without fear that what is said can be used against them at trial. The rule also seeks to exclude irrelevant evidence, recognizing that disputes are often settled for reasons having nothing to do with the merits of a claim. CTI Clinical Trial Servs. v.

Ohio 2013).</p></div><div><p class="pnormal" align="justify"><span class="loc" id="loc04215"></span>Rule 408 applies to situations where the party seeking to introduce evidence of a compromise was not involved in the original compromise; the offering of settlement evidence arising out of a shared factual nexus and bearing directly on present issues of liability between many of the same parties falls within the prohibition of the rule. It bars admission of settlement negotiations concerning a separate claim that arose out of the same events, involved the same parties, and raised the same liability question as the claim being litigated, because making the content of such a discussion available for use in related litigation would invite the very situation that Rule 408 is designed to avoid: the specter of a subsequent use of a prior settlement to prejudice a separate and discrete claim. Thus, where cases are related, the better view is that Rule 408 may exclude settlement proposals in one case from admission into evidence in the other case. Emcor Grp. v. Great Am. Ins.

It protects only those statements made by a defendant to the prosecuting attorney himself. The phrase “plea discussions” in Rule 410 has been construed to refer to only plea discussions themselves, and not simply anything that might ultimately lead to such discussions, and courts have explicitly rejected the argument that a preliminary discussion must be considered as part of the overall plea bargaining process for purposes of Rule 410. Thus, where a defendant purportedly made a statement in a letter addressed to a judge, and not to an attorney for the prosecuting authority, and there is no indication that the defendant was engaging in plea discussions at the time he wrote the letter containing the statement in question, the protection afforded by Rule 410 does not apply to that statement.

Proffer discussions fall within the protection of the rule, and requiring formal plea negotiations before a defendant could invoke the rule would contravene its purpose. But because Rule 410 is an exception to the general principle that all relevant evidence is admissible at trial, its limitations are not to be read broadly. The purpose of the rule can best be served if the accused is required, at least, to make manifest his intention to seek a plea bargain before he takes the route of self-incrimination.

Congress weighed the evidentiary concerns related to criminal plea negotiations when it enacted Rule <div class="notext"><p class="bpage" name="" id="">====== <b>370</b> ======</p></div><p></p>410, which enables a defendant to negotiate without fear that the prosecutor will use his statements against him and contemplates that plea negotiations should ordinarily be inadmissible against a defendant.

Such circumstances are not covered by the per se inadmissibility provision of Rule 410 and thus must be resolved by that body of law dealing with police interrogations. United States v.

Thus, a defendant must at least make manifest his intention to seek a plea bargain before he takes the route of self-incrimination. United States v. Riedman, 2014 U.S. Dist.

Other courts, including the Eighth Circuit, apply a narrower test, described in <a class="casename" data-docid="131999-CH" data-case-volume="458" data-case-reporter="F.3d" data-case-page="791" data-case-exclusion=", 458 F.3d 791, 804"><casename>United States v.

Still other courts, without explicitly applying either the <i>Robertson</i> or <i>Edelmann</i> frameworks, have focused on whether the defendant was reasonable in believing that the agent had authority to engage in plea discussions. Thus, an appropriate approach is to evaluate the totality of the circumstances, including whether the defendant expressed a subjective belief that he was engaged in plea negotiations at the time that he made the statements at issue and whether such belief was objectively reasonable.

Criminal forfeiture is an element of the sentence imposed following conviction or a plea of guilty. Congress plainly intended forfeiture of assets to operate as punishment for criminal conduct, not as a separate substantive offense, and the Supreme Court has likewise characterized criminal forfeiture as an aspect of punishment imposed following conviction of a substantive criminal offense.

The constitutional exception to the general prohibition against evidence of a victim’s other sexual behavior in Rule 412 is intended to cover those infrequent instances where, because of an unusual chain of circumstances, the general rule of inadmissibility, if followed, would result in denying the defendant a constitutional right.

Privileges must therefore be strictly construed and accepted only to the very limited extent that excluding relevant evidence has a public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth. Thus, the general rule disfavors testimonial privileges, and consistent with this general rule and its policy of restraint, the Supreme Court rarely expands common-law testimonial privileges.

Under the narrow approach, at the other end of the spectrum, courts have held that there must be an affirmative reliance on the psychotherapist-patient communications before the privilege will be deemed waived. There is also a “middle ground” approach, under which a waiver has been found when the plaintiff has done more than allege “garden-variety” emotional distress. In this context, “garden-variety emotional distress” has been described as ordinary or commonplace emotional distress, that which is simple or usual. In contrast, emotional distress that is not “garden variety” may be complex, such as that resulting in a specific psychiatric disorder. Valentine v. First Advantage Saferent, Inc., 2009 U.S. Dist.

Second, there is frequently greater-than-usual need for parental testimony in prosecutions for crimes against children, because child abuse occurs most often in the home at the hands of a parent or parent-substitute, and thus testimony regarding confidential marital communications may constitute critical evidence in such cases.

Union representatives may have various duties, including representing union members in disciplinary proceedings and internal investigations. In the course of representing a union member accused of some wrongdoing, a union representative may receive confidential information. This role is not unlike that of an attorney. As with the attorney-client privilege, there is a strong interest in encouraging an employee accused of wrongdoing to communicate fully and frankly with his union representative, in order to receive accurate advice about the disciplinary process. Thus, an employee-union representative privilege will extend to communications made (1) in confidence; (2) in connection with “representative” services relating to anticipated or ongoing disciplinary proceedings; (3) between an employee and his union representative; (4) where the union representative is acting in his or her official representative capacity.

Thus, tax returns are not protected from discovery where the subpoenaing party can show (1) that the documents requested are important to the case; and (2) the documents are not otherwise obtainable.

Courts are concerned with basic notions of fairness, aiming to prevent a party from disclosing communications supporting its position while simultaneously withholding communications that do not—judicial acknowledgment that selective waiver of the attorney-client privilege may lead to the inequitable result that the waiving party could waive its privilege for favorable advice while asserting its privilege on unfavorable advice.

Rule 502(d), which allows parties to deviate from the forgoing standard, is premised on efficiency. Zorek v. CVS Caremark Corp., 2014 U.S. Dist.

This is particularly true in litigation involving electronically stored information (ESI) and large amounts of documents. Where large amounts of ESI data or documents are responsive but only a few of which may turn out to be useful, it is less costly in terms of time and labor to conduct privilege review after the relevant documents have been identified. Rule 502(b) reflects this by permitting a party to retain the protections afforded by the attorney-client or work-product privilege for data or documents that have been inadvertently disclosed. However, it is a default rule that applies only in the absence of a court order or stipulation to the contrary. Zorek v. CVS Caremark Corp., 2014 U.S. Dist.

Seeking to rectify the harsh results of subject-matter waiver due to inadvertent disclosures, it takes a “middle ground” as to waiver. The touchstone of the waiver analysis is reasonableness. Inadvertent disclosure in connection with a federal proceeding does not constitute a waiver if the holder took reasonable steps to prevent disclosure and also promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the error.

Under the totality-of-the-circumstances test, the court considers five factors: (1) the reasonableness of precautions; (2) the amount of time taken to remedy the error; (3) the scope of discovery; (4) the extent of the disclosure; and (5) the overriding issue of fairness.

Accordingly, a “claw-back” agreement, often in the form of a stipulated protective order (sometimes referred to as a “Rule 502(d) order”), allows the producing party to avoid the uncertainties of Rule 502(b)’s reasonableness requirement by stipulating that any unintended production of privileged materials will be deemed “inadvertent” and returned to the producing party. Parties to such an agreement expressly agree that any inadvertent production will be excused, and no waiver of privilege will be deemed to have occurred.

Under the second test, a court applying Rule 502(b) determines whether a disclosure was inadvertent by (1) considering the production in light of the total number of documents reviewed, the procedures used to review the documents before they were produced, and the actions of producing party after discovering that the documents had been produced; and then (2) assessing whether the steps the producing party took in preventing disclosure and rectifying the disclosure were reasonable. <i>In re</i> Yasmin &amp; Yaz Prods.

To determine whether these aspects of Rule 502(b) are satisfied, some courts apply a five-factor test from prior case law that considers: (1) the reasonableness of the precautions to prevent inadvertent disclosure; (2) the time taken to rectify the error, (3) the scope of the discovery; (4) the extent of the disclosure; and (5) the overriding issue of fairness.

The privilege holder bears the burden of showing that he did not waive work-product protection. In cases of inadvertent disclosure (for example, mistakenly including protected documents in a voluntary and authorized production of non-privileged materials), courts generally weigh four factors to determine if that disclosure constitutes a waiver. The four factors are: (1) the reasonableness of the precautions taken by the producing party to prevent inadvertent disclosure of privileged documents; (2) the volume of discovery versus the extent of the specific disclosure at issue; (3) the length of time taken by the producing party to rectify the disclosure; and (4) the overarching issue of fairness. <i>In re</i> Grand Jury Subpoena, 2014 U.S. Dist.

The rule is designed to enable a court to enter an order that will allow the parties to conduct and respond to discovery expeditiously, without the need for exhaustive pre-production privilege reviews, while still preserving each party’s right to assert the privilege to preclude use in litigation of information disclosed in such discovery.

The rule provides that a voluntary disclosure in a federal proceeding or to a federal office or agency, if a waiver, generally results in a waiver only of the communication or information disclosed; a subject matter waiver (of either privilege or work product) is reserved for those unusual situations in which fairness requires a further disclosure of related, protected information, in order to prevent a selective and misleading presentation of evidence to the disadvantage of the adversary. Thus, subject matter waiver is limited to situations in which a party intentionally puts protected information into the litigation in a selective, misleading and unfair manner. It follows that an inadvertent disclosure of protected information can never result in a subject matter waiver. Leprino Foods Co. v. DCI, Inc., 94 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 1090 (D.

No lay witness, however, is permitted to opine that a particular incident proximately caused his or her mental and physical health problems or offer a medical diagnosis of his or her alleged injuries.

Together, the two sections of the rule attempt to strike a proper balance between two important, yet competing, interests. Thus, under Rule 606(b), although a juror can testify that she consulted an extraneous influence and related her findings to the panel, neither she nor any other juror can testify about any effect the extraneous influence may have had on the verdict or on the jury deliberations.

It applies during an inquiry into the validity of a verdict. A post-verdict motion for a new trial on the ground of voir dire dishonesty plainly entails an inquiry into the validity of the verdict, in that if a juror was dishonest during voir dire and an honest response would have provided a valid basis to challenge that juror for cause, the verdict must be invalidated. This is consistent with the underlying common-law rule on which Rule 606 was based. Although some common-law courts would have permitted evidence of jury deliberations to be introduced to demonstrate juror dishonesty during voir dire, the majority would not, and the language of Rule 606(b) reflects Congress’s enactment of the more restrictive version of the common-law rule.

Thus, in adopting the current version of Rule 606(b), Congress specifically understood, considered, and rejected an alternate version of Rule 606(b) that would have likely permitted the introduction of evidence of deliberations to show dishonesty during voir dire.

Conversely, if the case involves an internal influence, the rule does not permit the post-verdict interrogation of jurors.

In this regard, a juror’s testimony concerning his fear that individuals would retaliate against him if he voted to acquit (or convict) would be admissible, although his statement that he actually cast his vote one way or the other because of that fear would not. Further, evidence regarding any influence that such improper conduct or contacts had on the jurors’ abilities to fairly and impartially receive the evidence and listen to the testimony presented and the judge’s instructions is also admissible. Finally, the court may consider the likely consequence of actions that might cause jurors to feel intimidated regardless of whether the jurors admit such an effect. Thus, objective and subjective factors may both be considered under Rule 606. Roberts v. Warden, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14315 (E.D.

This means that the district court must examine this material to decide whether it falls within the categories of admissible juror testimony permitted by Rule 606(b), which permits testimony only on the questions of whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury’s attention and whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror. Within the exception, jurors are limited to testifying as to the existence and nature of extraneous evidence; testimony regarding the impact of such information on any juror or on the jury as a whole is prohibited.

Two circuits have found that Rule 606(b) is sometimes unconstitutional when applied to bar testimony about racial bias, and one circuit has suggested, without explicitly finding, that Rule 606(b) is always constitutional.

However, not every stray or isolated off-base statement made during deliberations requires a hearing at which jury testimony is taken, and such stray comments would not render Rule 606(b) unconstitutional.

Thus, evidence only that racial statements were made among members of the jury, and not that an outside communication caused the jury to become racially biased against the plaintiffs, is barred by Rule 606(b). The fact that some jurors’ racial statements may have influenced other jurors does not change this result. United States v. Shalhout, 90 Fed. R. Evid.

In addition, the First Circuit recognizes a fourth exception, based upon constitutional grounds, which under limited circumstances allows an inquiry into juror racial or ethnic bias during jury deliberations.
